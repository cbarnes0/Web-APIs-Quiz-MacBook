# <Web-APIs-Quiz>

## Description

The aim of the project was to add to create a functional quiz with a leaderboard using everything we have learned thusfar in class. Functional in this case means starting the quiz, being prompted with questions and a started timer, getting time taken away for incorrect quesions and space to store and view your score at the end. Through working on this project I was able to develop a deeper understand of JavaScript, DOM traversal, and beginner data storage ideas. This project is being submitted partially incomplete. Tasks that remain to be implemented is being able to write in initials and store them as well as viewing the leaderboards afterwards.
